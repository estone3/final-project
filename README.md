# final-project
This project was a learning experience for me, as I have never had any experience coding prior to this. I used Jeff Thompson's "torch-rnn" tutorial to complete this project. I produced two outputs through this tutorial: first, I produced a novel-length work after training my computer with the Shakespeare script that the tutorial provided. Then, I went back to the tutorial steps and trained my computer with Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice" text to produce another novel-length text. I learned a lot through this tutorial, and while the outputs where a bit nonsensical, it was still an interesting way to learn how to code and I learned a lot throughout the process.
